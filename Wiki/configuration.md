## Configuration

Trilium supports configuration via a file named `config.ini` and environment variables. Please review the file named `config-sample.ini` in the [Notes](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes) repository to see what values are supported.

You can provide the same values via environment variables instead of the `config.ini` file, and these environment variables use the following format:


1. Environment variables should be prefixed with `TRILIUM_` and use underscores to represent the INI section structure.
2. The format is: `TRILIUM_<SECTION>_<KEY>=<VALUE>`
3. The environment variables will override any matching values from config.ini

For example, if you have this in your config.ini:
```ini
[Network]
host=localhost
port=8080
```

You can override these values using environment variables:
```bash
TRILIUM_NETWORK_HOST=0.0.0.0
TRILIUM_NETWORK_PORT=9000
```

The code will:
1. First load the config.ini file as before
2. Then scan all environment variables for ones starting with `TRILIUM_`
3. Parse these variables into section/key pairs
4. Merge them with the config from the file, with environment variables taking precedence
