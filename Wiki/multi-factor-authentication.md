# Multi-Factor Authentication

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security process that requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a system, application, or account. This adds an extra layer of protection beyond just using a password.

By requiring more than one verification method, MFA helps reduce the risk of unauthorized access, even if someone has obtained your password. Itâ€™s highly recommended for securing sensitive information stored in your notes.

Warning! OpenID and TOTP cannot be both used at the same time!

## Log in with your Google Account with OpenID!

OpenID is a standardized way to let you log into websites using an account from another service, like Google, to verify your identity.

## Why Time-based One Time Passwords?

TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) is a security feature that generates a unique, temporary code on your device, like a smartphone, which changes every 30 seconds. You use this code, along with your password, to log into your account, making it much harder for anyone else to access them.

## Setup

### TOTP (Easier)

1. Go to "Options" -> "MFA"
1. Click the "Generate TOTP Secret" button
1. Copy the generated secret to your authentication app/extension
1. The environment variables can be set with a .env file in the root directory, or by defining them in the command line
    ```SH
    # .env in the project root directory
    TOTP_ENABLED="true"
    TOTP_SECRET="secret"
    ```
    ```SH
    # Terminal/CLI
    export TOTP_ENABLED="true"
    export TOTP_SECRET="secret"
    ```
    ```SH
    # Docker
    sudo docker run -p 8080:8080 -v ~/trilium-data:/home/node/trilium-data -e TOTP_ENABLED="true" -e TOTP_SECRET="secret" triliumnext/notes:[VERSION]
    ```
1. Restart Trilium
1. Go to "Options" -> "MFA"
1. Click the "Generate Recovery Codes" button
1. Save the recovery codes. Recovery codes can only be used once in place of TOTP and will show the unix timestamp when it was used in the MFA options tab.
1. Load the secret into an authentication app like google authenticator


### OpenID (Harder)
You will need to setup a authentication provider. Right now I have it working with Google, however I intend to have it work with other services like Authentik and Auth0. This requires a bit of extra setup. Follow [these instructions](https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/openid-connect) to setup an OpenID service through google.

#### .env File
```sh
# .env in the project root directory
SSO_ENABLED="true"
BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080"
CLIENT_ID=<client ID from google>
SECRET=<client secret from google>
```

#### Environment variable (linux)
```sh
export SSO_ENABLED="true"
export BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080"
export CLIENT_ID=<client ID from google>
export SECRET=<client secret from google>
```
#### Docker
```sh
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -v ~/trilium-data:/home/node/trilium-data -e SSO_ENABLED="true" -e BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080" -e CLIENT_ID=<client ID from google> -e SECRET=<client secret from google> triliumnext/notes:[VERSION]
```
You can now login and out with the service provider and should be able to login without using your password.
