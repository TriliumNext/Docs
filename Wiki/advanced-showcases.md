# Advanced showcases
Trilium provides some advanced functionality in the form of [Scripts](scripts.md) and [promoted attributes](promoted-attributes.md). To explain and visualize these features we've prepared few showcases which are also available in the [demo document](document.md):

*   [Relation map](relation-map.md)
*   [Day notes](day-notes.md)
*   [Weight Tracker](weight-tracker.md)
*   [Task Manager](task-manager.md)

An important thing to keep in mind is that above showcases and demoed functionality are not built-in into Trilium - these are just examples of Trilium's extensibility.
