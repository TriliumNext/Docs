# Note map
Note map is a visualization of connections between notes.

This provides an insight into a structure ("web") of notes.

There are two types of note map:

[Relation map](Relation-map.md) is a similar concept, with some differences:

*   note map is automatically generated while relation map must be created manually
*   relation map is a type of note while a link map is just virtual visualization
