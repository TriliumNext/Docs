# Read only note
[Text](text-notes.md) or [code](code-notes.md) can be set to be read-only. In such case only read view is presented to the user with the option of editing the note if needed.

Setting read only view with label
---------------------------------

You can set the note as read only by adding [label](attributes.md) `readOnly`.

Auto read only
--------------

If the note is too large then Trilium will automatically set the note as readOnly as an optimization - displaying such long notes can take a long time in editing mode and this might unnecessarily slow down operation even if editing is not necessary.

If you want to keep specific note automatically editable, you can add [label](attributes.md) `autoReadOnlyDisabled`.
