Overview

Basic overview of the Trilium project is available at project homepage - [https://github.com/zadam/trilium#trilium-notes](https://github.com/zadam/trilium#trilium-notes)

Inspiration for the name "Trilium":

> Naming software is hard. I lived in Ontario when I first started the project and Trillium (the flower) is sort of a provincial logo, many institutions in Ontario are named "Trillium \[something\]". So I kept hearing/reading it almost everyday, I liked the sound of it and its nature motif, so I just reused it.

Quick Start

Choose the setup
----------------

**Local only desktop/laptop** - Allows a single instance on a desktop and will save the notes locally on that desktop.

1.  [Desktop installation](desktop-installation.md)

**Server with web only access** - Installs the application on the server and allows access from any web browser on any device, including mobile.

1.  [Server installation](server-installation.md)
2.  [Mobile frontend](mobile-frontend.md) (optional)
3.  [![Deploy](images/Home%20button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/feilongfl/trilium-heroku)
4.  [3rd party paid service to host a Trilium instance for you](https://trilium.cc/paid-hosting)

**Combination of server and desktop/laptop** - Install the application on both a server, for web access and data synchronization, and desktop instance(s). This allows all the data to be stored on the server and either accessed from the web browser, or the desktop application. The desktop application will sync and store the data locally so that it can be used when offline.

1.  [Server installation](server-installation.md)
2.  [Mobile frontend](mobile-frontend.md) (optional)
