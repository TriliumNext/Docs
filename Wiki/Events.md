# Events
[Script](Scripts.md) notes can be triggered by events. Note that these are backend events and thus relation need to point to the "JS backend" code note.

Global events
-------------

Global events are attached to the script note via label. Simply create e.g. "run" label with some of these values and script note will be executed once the event occurs.

*   `run`
    *   `frontendStartup` - executes on frontend upon startup
    *   `mobileStartup` - executes on mobile frontend upon startup
    *   `backendStartup` - executes on backend upon startup
    *   `hourly` - executes once an hour on backend
    *   `daily` - executes once a day on backend

Entity events
-------------

Other events are bound to some entity, these are defined as [relations](Attributes.md) - meaning that script is triggered only if note has this script attached to it through relations (or it can inherit it).

*   `runOnNoteCreation` - executes when note is created on backend
*   `runOnNoteTitleChange` - executes when note title is changed (includes note creation as well)
*   `runOnNoteContentChange` - executes when note content is changed (includes note creation as well).
*   `runOnNoteChange` - executes when note is changed (includes note creation as well)
*   `runOnNoteDeletion` - executes when note is being deleted
*   `runOnBranchCreation` - executes when a branch is created. Branch is a link between parent note and child note and is created e.g. when cloning or moving note.
*   `runOnBranchChange` (since v0.62) - executes when a branch is changed - either expanded status or prefix are changed.
*   `runOnBranchDeletion` - executes when a branch is delete. Branch is a link between parent note and child note and is deleted e.g. when moving note (old branch/link is deleted).
*   `runOnChildNoteCreation` - executes when new note is created under _this_ note
*   `runOnAttributeCreation` - executes when new attribute is created under _this_ note
*   `runOnAttributeChange` - executes when attribute is changed under _this_ note
