# Sorting
One time sorting
----------------

You can sort notes one time by right-clicking parent note in the note tree, Advanced -> Sort notes by ...

Automatic / permanent sorting
-----------------------------

Child notes can be kept sorted by attaching [labels](attributes.md) to the parent note:

*   `#sorted` - enables sorting, can optionally include name of the note's property/label (see details below)
*   `#sortDirection` - by default ascending, set it to `desc` value to reverse the sort order
*   `#sortFoldersFirst` - notes with children will be sorted on top

Sorting works by comparing note property or a specific label on the child notes.

There are 4 sorting levels, where the first one has the highest priority and the lower one will be applied only if the 2 compared notes are equal based on higher priority comparison.

1.  implicit sorting by `#top` label - child notes with this label will appear on the top of the folder.
2.  implicit sorting by `#bottom` label (since Trilium 0.62) - child notes with this label will appear on the bottom of the folder.
3.  sorting by child's property or a specific label defined on the parent note's `#sorted` label a) parent note has `#sorted` with no value - by default sorting will be done alphabetically b) parent note has `#sorted=title` or `#sorted=dateModified` or `#sorted=dateCreated` - sorting will be done based on the defined note's property c) parent note has `#sorted` label with any other value - this value is the name of the child note's label, whose value will be used for sorting. So e.g. you set `#sorted=myOrder` on the parent note and then child notes will have labels `#myOrder=001`, \`#myOrder=002" etc.
4.  sorting of "last resort" is alphabetical

All comparisons are made string-wise - e.g. "1" < "2" or "2020-10-10" < "2021-01-15" but also "2" > "10".
