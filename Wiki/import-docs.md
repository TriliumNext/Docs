# Importing Documentation

To import these docs into your own Trilium instance:

1. Download archive from main branch of this repo:
https://github.com/TriliumNext/Docs/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
2. In Trilim create a new note to act as branch for the docs
3. Right-click on the note, select "Import into note" and select downloaded `Docs-main.zip` file. 
    - Optionally uncheck "Shrink images"

## Optional cleanup
- delete `!!!meta.json`
- Move `images` node down to the bottom (instead of dragging, it's easier to move out to parent node than back into Wiki. It will go to end of list automatically).

For new releases delete the old docs note tree and start fresh, or you'll get duplicates.
