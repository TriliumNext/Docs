# Attributes in Trilium

In Trilium, attributes are key-value pairs assigned to notes, providing additional metadata or functionality. There are two primary types of attributes:

1. **Labels**: Simple key-value text records.
2. **Relations**: Named links to other notes.

These attributes play a crucial role in organizing, categorizing, and enhancing the functionality of notes.

## Labels

Labels in Trilium can be used for a variety of purposes:

- **Metadata**: Assign labels with optional values for categorization, such as `#year=1999`, `#genre="sci-fi"`, or `#author="Neal Stephenson"`.
- **Configuration**: Labels can configure advanced features or settings.
- **Scripts and Plugins**: Used to tag notes with special metadata, such as the "weight" attribute in the [Weight Tracker](weight-tracker.md).

Labels are also searchable, enhancing note retrieval.

### Common Labels for Advanced Configuration

- **`disableVersioning`**: Disables automatic versioning, ideal for large, unimportant notes like script libraries.
- **`calendarRoot`**: Marks the note as the root for [day notes](day-notes.md). Only one note should carry this label.
- **`archived`**: Hides notes from default search results and dialogs.
- **`excludeFromExport`**: Excludes notes and their subtrees from export operations.
- **`run`**: Specifies events to trigger scripts (e.g., `frontendStartup`, `hourly`).
- **`runAtHour`**: Defines specific hours for scripts to run, used with `#run=hourly`.
- **`disableInclusion`**: Prevents a script from being included in parent script executions.
- **`sorted`**: Automatically sorts child notes alphabetically by title.
- **`top`**: Keeps the note at the top of its parent's list, useful with `sorted`.
- **`hidePromotedAttributes`**: Hides certain attributes in the note's display.
- **`readOnly`**: Sets the note to read-only mode, applicable to text and code notes.
- **`autoReadOnlyDisabled`**: Disables automatic read-only mode for large notes.
- **`appCss`**: Marks CSS notes used to modify Trilium’s appearance.
- **`appTheme`**: Marks full CSS themes available in Trilium's options.
- **`cssClass`**: Adds a CSS class to the note's representation in the tree.
- **`iconClass`**: Adds a CSS class to the note's icon, useful for distinguishing notes visually.
- **`pageSize`**: Specifies the number of items per page in note listings.
- **`customRequestHandler` and `customResourceProvider`**: Refer to [Custom request handler](custom-request-handler.md).
- **`widget`**: Marks a note as a custom widget, added to Trilium's component tree.
- **`workspace` and related attributes**: See [Workspace](workspace.md) for more details.
- **`searchHome`**: Specifies the parent for new search notes.
- **`inbox`**: Designates a default location for new notes created via the sidebar.
- **`sqlConsoleHome`**: Default location for SQL console notes.
- **`bookmarked` and `bookmarkFolder`**: See [Bookmarks](bookmarks.md).
- **`shareXXX`**: See [Sharing](sharing.md).
- **`keyboardShortcut`**: Assigns a keyboard shortcut to open the note.
- **`displayRelations` and `hideRelations`**: Manages the display of note relations.
- **`titleTemplate`**: See [Default note title](default-note-title.md).
- **`template`**: Makes the note available as a template.
- **`toc`**: Controls the visibility of the table of contents.
- **`color`**: Defines the color of the note in the tree and links.
- **`hideChildrenOverview`**: Hides child notes in the parent note's editor.
- **`viewType`**: Sets the view of child notes (grid or list).

## Relations

Relations define connections between notes, similar to links.

### Uses

- **Metadata Relationships**: For example, linking a book note to an author note.
- **Scripting**: Attaching scripts to events or conditions related to the note.

### Common Relations

- **Event-based Relations**: Such as `runOnNoteCreation` or `runOnNoteChange`, which trigger scripts on specific actions.
- **Other Relations**: Include `template`, `renderNote`, `widget`, and sharing-related relations.

## Multiplicity

Attributes in Trilium can be multivalued, meaning multiple attributes with the same name can coexist, known as "multivalued" attributes.

## Attribute Definitions and Promoted Attributes

Special labels create "label/attribute" definitions, enhancing the organization and management of attributes. For more details, see [Promoted attributes](promoted-attributes.md).

## Attribute Inheritance

Trilium supports attribute inheritance, allowing child notes to inherit attributes from their parents. For more information, see [Attribute inheritance](attribute-inheritance.md).
