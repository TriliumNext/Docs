# Script API

Trilium offers a "Script API" that enables scripts to perform various useful functions. There are two main APIs available:

- [Frontend API](https://triliumnext.github.io/Notes/frontend_api/FrontendScriptApi.html)
- [Backend API](https://triliumnext.github.io/Notes/backend_api/BackendScriptApi.html)

Please note that the Script API is currently experimental and may undergo changes in future updates.
