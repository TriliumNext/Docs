# Text-notes
Trilium uses awesome [CKEditor 5](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/) as its editing component.

Formatting
----------

Trilium text note interface doesn't show any toolbars or formatting options by default, these needs to be brought up by:

1.  selecting text will bring up an inline toolbar:

1.  clicking on the block toolbar:

Read only vs. editing mode
--------------------------

Text notes are normally opened in edit mode, however there are two cases when they are open in read-only mode:

*   they are long and thus would take time to load so by default we open them as read only which is much quicker
*   or the note has `readOnly` [label](attributes.md)

In both cases, it is possible to switch to editable mode again.

General Formatting
------------------

Trilium uses the CKEditor, so any formatting that the CKEditor supports should be available in Trilium. For example:

**Bold** – Type `**text**` or `__text__`

_Italic_ – Type `*text*` or `_text_`

`Code` – Type \`text\`

~Strikethrough~ – Type `~~text~~`

### Lists

*   Bulleted list – Start a line with `*` or `-` followed by a space

1.  Numbered list – Start a line with `1.` or `1)` followed by a space

\[ \] To-do list – Start a line with `[ ]` or `[x]` followed by a space to insert an unchecked or checked list item, respectively

### Blocks

> Block quote – Start a line with `>` followed by a space

`Multi-line Code block` – Start a line with \`\`\`

### Other

Headings – Start a line with `##` or `###` followed by a space to create a heading 1, heading 2, or heading 3 (up to heading 6 if options defines more headings)

Note: Trilium only accepts headings with `##` and more because `#` is reserved for the title

Horizontal line – Start a line with `---`
-----------------------------------------

Markdown & Autoformat
---------------------

CKEditor supports markdown-like editing experience. It recognizes syntax and automatically converts it to rich text. See it in action:

Complete documentation for this feature is available in [CKEditor documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/autoformat.html).

If the autoformat is not desirable for what you just wrote, you can press `CTRL-Z` which will un-autoformat the text to its original form.

Note that the use of `#` for Heading1 style is not supported because the editor assumes that is used for the title, start with `##` for Heading2. Explanation [here](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/headings.html#heading-levels).

Math support
------------

Trilium provides Math support with the help of KaTex:

Cut selection to sub-note
-------------------------

One of the common situations in Trilium is when you're editing a document, and it gets somewhat large, so you start splitting it up into sub-notes - the process is essentially like this:

*   select the desired piece of text and cut it into clipboard
*   create new sub-note & give it name
*   paste the content from clipboard into sub-note

Trilium provides a way to automate this:

You can notice how heading "Formatting" is automatically detected and new sub-note is named "Formatting".

It is also possible to assign a keyboard shortcut for this action.

Include note
------------

Text notes can "include" another note as a read only widget. This can be useful for e.g. including a dynamically generated chart (from scripts & "render HTML" note) or other more advanced use cases.

This functionality is available in the block toolbar icon.
