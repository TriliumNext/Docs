# Note revisions
Trilium supports seamless versioning of notes by storing snapshots ("revisions") of notes at regular intervals.

Time interval of taking note snapshot is configurable in the Options -> Other dialog. This provides a tradeoff between more revisions and more data to store.

To turn off note versioning for a particular note (or subtree), add `disableVersioning` [label](attributes.md) to the note.

Note revisions can be accessed through the button on the right of ribbon toolbar.
