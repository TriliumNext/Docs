# Note hoisting
Hoisting is a standard outliner feature which allows you to focus on (or "zoom into") a specific note and its subtree by hiding all parent and sibling notes. Demo:

In addition to showing only this subtree, this also narrows both full text search and [“jump to note”](note-navigation.md) to just notes present in hoisted subtree.

See also [Workspace](workspace.md) which extends this feature.
