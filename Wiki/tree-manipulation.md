# Tree Manipulation

This page explains how to manipulate the note tree in TriliumNext, focusing on moving notes.

## Drag and Drop

You can easily rearrange the note tree by dragging and dropping notes, as demonstrated in the example above.

## Keyboard Manipulation

![Example of using keyboard keys to move a note](images/move-note-with-keyboard.gif)
Trilium offers efficient keyboard-based manipulation using the following [shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.md):

- `CTRL-UP` and `CTRL-DOWN`: Move the note up or down in the order.
- `CTRL-LEFT`: Move the note up in the hierarchy by changing its parent to the note's grandparent.
- `CTRL-RIGHT`: Move the note down in the hierarchy by setting its parent to the note currently above it (this action is best understood through a demo or hands-on experience).
- `LEFT` and `RIGHT`: Expand and collapse a sub-tree.

## Context Menu

You can also move notes using the familiar cut and paste functions available in the context menu, or with the associated keyboard [shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.md): `CTRL-X` (cut) and `CTRL-V` (paste).
