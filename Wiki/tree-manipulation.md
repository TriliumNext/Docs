# Tree manipulation
This page describes how you can manipulate the note tree - specifically moving notes.

Drag and drop
-------------

You can manipulate the tree simply by dragging and dropping notes as you can see in the demo:

Keyboard manipulation
---------------------

Trilium provides fast keyboard based manipulation with following [shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.md):

*   `CTRL-UP` and `CTRL-DOWN` - move note up or down in the order
*   `CTRL-LEFT` - move note upwards in the hierarchy by changing a note's parent to note's parent's parent.
*   `CTRL-RIGHT` - move note downwards in the hierarchy by setting parent to the note currently above (this is a bit hard to explain - it's best to see a demo or try it for yourself)
*   `LEFT` and `RIGHT` expands and collapses a sub-tree

Context menu
------------

You can also move notes with familiar cut & paste from context menu or associated keyboard [shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.md) `CTRL-X` (cut) and `CTRL-V` (paste).
