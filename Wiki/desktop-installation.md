# Desktop Installation Guide for Trilium

To install Trilium on your desktop, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Latest Release**: Obtain the appropriate binary release for your operating system from the [latest release page](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/releases/latest) on GitHub.
2. **Extract the Package**: Unzip the downloaded package to a location of your choice.
3. **Run the Application**: Launch Trilium by executing the `trilium` executable found within the unzipped folder.

## Startup Scripts

Trilium offers various startup scripts to customize your experience:

- **`trilium-no-cert-check`**: Starts Trilium without validating [TLS certificates](tls-configuration.md), useful if connecting to a server with a self-signed certificate.
  - Alternatively, set the `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` environment variable before starting Trilium.

- **`trilium-portable`**: Launches Trilium in portable mode, where the [data directory](data-directory.md) is created within the application's directory, making it easy to move the entire setup.

- **`trilium-safe-mode`**: Boots Trilium in "safe mode," disabling any startup scripts that might cause the application to crash.

## Synchronization

For Trilium desktp users who wish to synchronize their data with a server instance, refer to the [Synchronization Guide](synchronization.md) for detailed instructions.
