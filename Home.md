# Overview
Basic overview of the Trilium project is available at project homepage - https://github.com/zadam/trilium#trilium-notes

Inspiration for the name "Trilium":
> Naming software is hard. I lived in Ontario when I first started the project and Trillium (the flower) is sort of a provincial logo, many institutions in Ontario are named "Trillium [something]". So I kept hearing/reading it almost everyday, I liked the sound of it and its nature motif, so I just reused it.

4. [3rd party paid service to host a Trilium instance for you](https://trilium.cc/paid-hosting)

**Combination of server and desktop/laptop** - Install the application on both a server, for web access and data synchronization, and desktop instance(s). This allows all the data to be stored on the server and either accessed from the web browser, or the desktop application. The desktop application will sync and store the data locally so that it can be used when offline.
