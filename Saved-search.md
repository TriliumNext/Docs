Trilium provides a way to save common search as a note in the note tree. Search results will then appear as sub-notes of this "saved search" note. You can see how this works in action:

## Location

Saved search is by default stored in the day note. You can also mark some note with `#searchHome` label, all saved searches will be then saved there. There's also `#workspaceSearchHome` variant for [[workspaces|workspace]].
